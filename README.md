Adversarial machine learning session: hands-on

# Adversarial Machine Learning â€” Python Environment Setup

Welcome to this hands-on session on adversarial machine learning!

## Data
First, [download the data required for the hands-on (250MB), given as a python pickle file.](https://insatoulousefr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/leleux_insa-toulouse_fr/EUCHgBl7cztNj6gTlg0C6kcBhhoAzGckWTlxdqasQdjgNw?e=R7xfWU)
This data was extracted from the CIFAR100 public dataset with super classes.

## Practical session
The main part of the hands-on is the notebook: 2025-07-09_FRomeu_hands-on-AML.ipynb.

Since it could be a little long on the first part, I also give a version where this first part (preprocessing data, setting up classification model) is done.
**You can choose where to start from**, since setting up the machine learning model can be good experience for some of you.

## Installation
Here are instructions to install the Python libraries you will need for the session.

The best is to start from a fresh environment. You can choose between:

* **Using conda** (recommended if you already have Anaconda)
* **Using venv** (built-in Python virtual environments)

---

## Recommended approach: using conda

### Create and activate a new conda environment
We will create an environment named `adversarial` and set Python version 3.9:

```bash
conda create -n adversarial python=3.9
conda activate adversarial_tf
```

### Install python

```bash
conda install python=3.9 ipykernel -y
```

### Install packages

Install required packages from the requirements file

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** the packages include `adversarial-robustness-toolbox` (ART): a library from IBM for creating and evaluating adversarial attacks and defenses.
We focus on this library.

## Recommended approach: using venv

### Create and activate a new virtual environment
We will create an environment named `adversarial`:

```bash
python -m venv adversarial
source ./adversarial/bin/activate

### Install packages

Install required packages from the requirements file

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements

## Check your installation

Once installed, verify that you can import the main libraries:

```bash
python
```

Then in the Python prompt:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
import art
import numpy
import matplotlib
```

---

## Final notes

* Be careful to activate your environment before running code or notebooks.
* Use `conda deactivate` (for conda) or `deactivate` (for venv) to exit the environment.
* To create a Jupyter kernel for your environment (so it appears as an option in notebooks):

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name adversarial_tf --display-name "Python (adversarial)"
```
